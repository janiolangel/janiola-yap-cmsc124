Language Chosen: Python

1. How is a variable declared?
   
     In Python, you make a variable by assigning a value with `=`.
     You don’t declare its type—Python automatically decides it while running.
     For example, `x = 10` is a number, then `x = "hi"` becomes a string.

2. What keywords are reserved by the programming language?
   
    Python has a fixed set of reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers,
    such as `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `import`, and `return`.
    The full list is available through the `keyword` module in the standard library.
    
3. Is whitespace significant? Or is it bracketed like the C family of programming languages?
   
    In Python, whitespace (indentation) matters because it defines code blocks.
    Unlike C, Java, or C++ which use { } braces, Python relies on consistent indentation
    (commonly four spaces) to group statements, keeping the code clean and easy to read.

4. How are comments styled? Are nested or docstring-style comments allowed?
   
    In Python, single-line comments start with `#`, while triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`)
    are used for multi-line comments or docstrings. Nested comments aren’t allowed, and
    triple-quoted text is really just a string, but it’s often used for documentation or
    block comments if left unassigned.

5. How does it do loops and other common language constructs?
   
    Python uses `for` loops to go through sequences and `while` loops to
    run while a condition is true. It also has `if`, `elif`, and `else` for
    conditionals, making code simpler and more readable.

8. Why is it this way? What is the motivation behind your choices?
   
    Python focuses on readability and simplicity, using indentation, 
    dynamic typing, and high-level features to cut extra code. 
    Its “one obvious way” idea makes it beginner-friendly yet powerful.
